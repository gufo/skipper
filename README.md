# Skipper: Experimental fast file filter #

Skipper is meant to quickly help you find the files you are looking for. In
essence, it's an attempt to introduce better heuristics into
[CtrlP](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim).

Performance is probably not yet where it should be. On a moderately large Rails
project, skipper needs around 10-15 ms.

For now, consider it highly experimental and very unsupported.
